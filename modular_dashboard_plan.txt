Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task of creating modular dashboards for students, staff, and admin:

### Plan:
1. **Modularize the Sidebar**:
   - Create a separate sidebar component that can be reused across the admin, staff, and student dashboards. This will include links to the various functionalities available to each user role.

2. **Modularize the Main Content**:
   - Each grid item in the dashboards will be converted into a separate component. This allows for easy customization and reuse across different dashboards.

3. **Create Separate Dashboard Files**:
   - Ensure that the new modular components are integrated into the existing dashboard files for admin, staff, and student. This will involve updating the existing files to utilize the new components.

4. **Styling**:
   - Move the embedded CSS from each dashboard file into a separate stylesheet for better organization and maintainability.

5. **Testing**:
   - After implementing the changes, thoroughly test each dashboard to ensure that all functionalities work as expected and that the modular components are functioning correctly.

### Follow-Up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.

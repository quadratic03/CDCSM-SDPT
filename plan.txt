Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task:

### Plan:
1. **Modify `users.sql`**:
   - Correct the syntax error in the line `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS use 'user_db';` to properly create the database.
   - Update the insert statements to store plain text passwords instead of hashed passwords.

2. **Update `admin_registration.php`**:
   - Change the password handling logic to store the password in plain text instead of using `password_hash()`.
   - Ensure that the SQL insert statement aligns with the structure defined in `users.sql`.

### Follow-Up Steps:
- Verify that the changes are correctly implemented.
- Test the registration process to ensure that users can register with plain text passwords.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
